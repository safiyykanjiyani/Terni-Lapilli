# Terni-Lapilli
This is a minimax implementation of Terni Lapilli or Rota, an ancient game similar to Tic Tac Toe but more complex. This is written in Python and intended to serve as a coding challenge solution to a company I was applying for. 

Once you add your email to the rotarequests.py, you can authenticate to play Terni-Lapilli with a certain company's computer. Enjoy
